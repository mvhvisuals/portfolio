			<p>Here's a challenge for you: Name one dish that can be eaten as a snack, an appetizer, and a main course; that's equally delicious both hot and cold; that almost anyone would be happy to eat at any time of day or night; that is just as perfect for your kid's lunchbox as it is alongside a stiff drink; that's considered as much the domain of home cooks as of restaurant chefs; and that's composed of only a few very ordinary ingredients.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>1 3/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
				<li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat 1 1/2 cups of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the onions and potatoes. Season with 1 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
		<li>As the potatoes cook, press down on them gently with your spatula. Cook potatoes until fork tender. Don’t let the potatoes get mushy. When the potatoes and onions are done, transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
		<li>In medium bowl, beat the eggs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
		<li>Add the potatoes and onions to the egg mixture; mix well. All the potatoes should be covered, but not swimming in egg. There should be some extra egg at the top, so if the 5 eggs are not enough add another.</li>
		<li>Heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in another large skillet over medium-low heat. When the olive oil is hot, pour in the egg, potato and onion mixture; flatten and DON’T TOUCH AGAIN. Let cook until bottom is set.</li>
		<li>Place a large plate upside down over the top of the skillet. Hold it firmly in place. Pick up the pan from the handle with your free hand, and flip the half cooked tortilla over onto the plate. This needs to be quick. Place the skillet back on the stove and gently slide the tortilla, uncooked side down, back into the skillet.</li>
		<li>Cook until you can feel the tortilla slide a bit in the frying pan. Turn off the flame, serve out of the pan or flip the tortilla onto a plate to serve</li>
